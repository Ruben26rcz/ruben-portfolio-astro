				<p>
					I started working in Insorvet as an Industrial Design Engineer developing new osteosyntesis plates for pets,
					and making some cool renders. My curiosity drove me to improve the e-commerce webpage they were using. The
					service was plenty of funcionality issues where clients get lost very easily. I proposed to the owner the idea
					to redesign it. This project was planned as an effort-priority chart. The effortless and more prio the needs
					were faster must be solved.

				<h3>üéØ The aim</h3>
				<p>
					The aim was to remake the actual page in order to design a better user experience and reduce bounce rate. The
					main problem of the old website was that new visitors didn't trust in the e-commerce as much as the owner
					would like. There wasn't enough multimedia content to convince the user about the quality of the product.
				</p>

				<h3>üîë The solution</h3>
				<p>
					The website was developed with Wordpress and Elementor plugin. At this moment I didn't have the knowledge to
					achieve such a big programming challenge. I focused in designing the UI in Figma and test with users.
