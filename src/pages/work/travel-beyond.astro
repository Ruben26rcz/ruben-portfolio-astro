				<h3>✍️ From content to design</h3>
				<p>
					Content defines design. The aim of this project was to design the UI of a landing page departing from the
					content. Usually designers fall in the temptation to use Lorem ipsum default texts. This ends up making wrong
					design decisions. All the structure of this project was made based on the conent.
				</p>

				<h3>🗂 “Mini” Design System</h3>
				<p>
					To be honest, a landing page doesn't need a design system. But I really wanted to design it because I had the
					desire to start in this world of grouping components like if were going to start a lego project, that's why I
					name it “mini”.
				</p>
				<Image src={imgDesignSystem} alt='Mini design system of Travel Beyond' />

				<h3>📱 Mobile First & Responsive</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes when we make a desktop UI we end up making impossible designs for smaller devices. This project was
					developed first in mobile to prevent future headaches trying to fit all the nice and lovely content from
					desktop into mobile.

				<h3>🖥 Desktop Prototype</h3>
				<p>
					Desktop designs can be more shocking in terms of user experience. Taking in mind the content displayed in
					mobile I decided to add an interaction of scrolling down with full screen of each section.
