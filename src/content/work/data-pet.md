# An app that suggests movies based on your mood.

Kimood is like having a film-loving friend in your pocket. With its swipe left/swipe right feature, you can easily explore and discover films that resonate with you. Plus, you can connect with friends, see what they’ve been watching, and find films you both love.

## The Challenge

The aim of this project was to design a mobile app that recommends independent films based on the user's current mood. To refine the focus of this project, I began by creating a business canvas to define and organise the product's business model. Consequently, I defined the product vision and goal, the product values (innovation, friendliness and warmth), and the jobs to be done.

## User Archetype

The aim of this project was to design a mobile app that recommends independent films based on the user's current mood. To refine the focus of this project, I began by creating a <span class="accent">business canvas</span> to define and organise the product's business model. Consequently, I defined the product vision and goal, the product values (innovation, friendliness and warmth), and the jobs to be done.

## Benchmark

I conducted benchmarking, focusing on both <span class="accent">direct and indirect</span> competitors, as well as seeking <span class="accent">inspiration</span>. This allowed me to pinpoint the strenghts and weaknesses of comparable applications and gather innovative ideas. The benchmarking provided me with a comprehensive market insight and helped in defining strategies to set my app apart, delivering distinctive value to users.

## Moodboard

Before diving into the design process, I decided to create a moodboard to capture the design concept, tone, and overall style I envisioned for the app. Additionally, I wanted the moodboard to <span class="accent">mirror the values</span> I had previously outlined.

## Wireframing

After defining the happy path and various <span class="accent">user flows</span>, I initiated the creation of wireframes for the different screens of the app, allowing me to visualise the <span class="accent">functionality and layout</span>. Additionally, I facilitated receiving <span class="accent">user feedback</span> through rapid testing to assess the attractiveness of the concept and the comprehensibility of the introduced mechanics.

## Design System

Employing a design system was crucial for ensuring <span class="accent">consistency, efficiency, and scalability</span> throughout the development process of the app. It also plays a significant role in creating a cohesive and polished user experience.

## Naming

The app name <span class="accent">Kimood</span> is derived from merging "kibun" with "mood". Kibun is a Japanese term meaning "feeling" or "mood". Thus, the combination of these words forms the app's distinctive name.

On the other hand, the <span class="accent">logo ilustration</span> has been designed to evoke a mix of different moods, harmonising with the app's aesthetic.

## Prototype

Thanks to all the preceding steps, I successfully <span class="accent">designed the interface</span>, always based on the values I aimed to convey and the users' needs.

Kimood's dynamic differs from other movie recommendation apps in that it suggests only one film. You can <span class="accent">swipe left</span> to load another option or <span class="accent">swipe right</span> to select the film and view the available platforms.
